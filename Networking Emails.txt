“New Las Vegas Developer seeking advice”
Hi William. I’m Natasha. I’m a new developer interested in working for Clark County. I noticed that you were a full stack developer with Clark County. I am currently in an apprenticeship for full stack web development and also recently applied for the full stack developer position posted on the company's site. I would love to buy you a cup of coffee to hear about your experience there and any advice that you may be able to lend on the journey into the tech industry. Thank you in advance for your time and any consideration.
